/**
 * A revision commit is an immutable data structure that represents the full state of the repository
 * at a given point in time (by pointing to a root {@link RevTree tree}), and contains information
 * about who and when created the snapshot, as well as what commit or commits it was created from
 * (it's parent commit(s)), and an author provided message explaining the rationale for the
 * snapshot.
 * <p>
 * A commit is a root entry point to the revision graph ({@code commit [1]-> tree [0..N]-> tree 
 * <FeatureType> [0..N]-> feature}).
 * <p>
 * A commit by itself does not represent a set of changes to the repository. By pointing to a root
 * {@link RevTree tree}, it represents a whole dataset (i.e. a full snapshot of the repository at a
 * given point in time).
 * <p>
 * Since a commit also has pointer(s) to it's parent(s) commit(s) ({@link #getParentIds()}), the set
 * of changes between a given commit and any of its parent commits is to be computed by computing
 * the differences between the tree the commit points to and one of its parents'. In fact, the
 * differences between one commit an any other can be computed just as easily.
 * <p>
 * A {@code RevCommit} contains information about the {@link #getAuthor() author} and
 * {@link #getCommitter() committer}.
 * <p>
 * The <b>author</b> is the individual that created the repository snapshot (i.e. the root tree a
 * commit points to). What exactly the author contributed is to be determined by computing the
 * differences between the snapshot and the commit's parents.
 * <p>
 * The <b>committer</b> is the individual that created the commit object itself, as opposed to the
 * data it points to.
 * <p>
 * Author and committer are most of the time the same, but in some cases they may not be. Sometimes,
 * the commit history may be re-written, for example to fix a typo in a commit message, to replay
 * the changes a commit represents with regard to its parent on top of another commit (so-called
 * "rebasing"), or to apply a patch given as a patch file with contents authored by someone else.
 * Since commits are immutable data structures, in such cases a new commit must be created, and the
 * resulting commit will still credit the original author, but record the individual that created
 * the new commit as the committer.

     * orphan branch (like the first commit at all created in a given repository, or the first
     * created in a branch that wasn't forked from another branch - hence the name "orphan branch
     * -)."
     * <p>
     * A commit with one single parent identifier is a snapshot that was created on top of another
     * one.
     * <p>
     * A commit with more than one parent is called a "merge commit", as the root tree it points to
     * is the result of merging together the contents of the root trees the parent commits point to.
     * <p>
     * The process of merging the parents' root trees to create the merge commit's root tree may
     * fail due to conflicts, for example, if the two parents modified the same attribute of the
     * same feature with a different value, relative to the commits' common ancestor. In that case,
     * the conflict needs to be resolved before creating the final root tree.
     * <p>
     * A commit with more than one parent identifier is the result of merging two or more branches
     * together, so that each parent id points to the tip of one of the merged branches (note the
     * mention of merging branches is because that's the most common use case, but it doesn't really
     * need to be the tip of an actual branch, the merged commits may have been selected
     * individually regardless of being the tip of a branch or not).

     *           conflicts between any of the commits to be merged.
