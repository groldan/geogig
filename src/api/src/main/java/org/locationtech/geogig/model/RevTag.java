/**
 * An immutable data structure used to permanently mark a named repository snapshot.
 * <p>
 * The same way {@link RevCommit commits} point to a root {@link RevTree tree}, representing a full
 * repository datasets snapshot at a given point in time, {@link RevTag tags} point to a commit in
 * order to permanently signal a repository datasets snapshot of interest.
 * <p>
 * For example, as the datasets in the repository evolve, tags may be used to mark production
 * versions. A tag has a name and a pointer to a commit. So a versioning scheme could be defined to
 * track snapshots of datasets, such as tags named {@code version-1.0}, {@code version-2.0}, etc.
 * <p>
 * The same way the current tip commit of a branch is referred to by a {@link Ref} object in the
 * {@code refs/heads} namespace, tags are referred to by {@link Ref}s in the {@code refs/tags}
 * namespace, and the ref values are the {@link ObjectId} of the {@code RevTag} object instead of
 * the objectId of the {@link RevCommit} object.
 * 
 * @implNote several operations are expected to resolve ref names to the commit or root tree they
 *           ultimately point to, regardless of the ref name pointing to a tag, a commit, or a tree.
 * 
 * @since 1.0
